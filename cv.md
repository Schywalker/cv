I'm a developer with a strong systems background, with my work focusing on backend applications. I'd classify myself as a 'Full stack' developer, as i am comfortable working on a software project at any level, i'm experienced in providing a solution from the hardware, all the way up to testing and deployment, with experience in every stage in between. I began my career as a linux systems administrator, and made a natural progression into software development. My work would be considered diverse, being able to provide results in varying programming languages and environments, which are chosen to best fit the acceptance criteria, and team i'm working with. My ability to learn and adapt has been crucial in my career, and it's something i strive for every day, be it learning a new language in my free time, or familiarizing myself with a new technology i may work with. I'd consider myself a craftsman, and as such strive to achieve that in my work and free time
